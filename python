""" Implement a program to convert time input provided in hours, minutes, and seconds into a decimal representation. 



The program should allow the user to enter a time in the format HH:MM:SS, where HH represents hours, MM represents minutes, and SS represents seconds. The program should then convert this input into a decimal representation.



Function Signature: convert_time()

Input format :
The input consists of a string in the format "HH:MM:SS", where HH, MM, and SS are integers representing hours, minutes, and seconds.

Output format :
The output prints a decimal representation of the input time, breaking down into hours as integers, minutes with two decimal places, and seconds as floating-point number.

The format of the output should be: "X hours, Y.YY minutes, and Z.ZZ seconds in decimal representation."""

def convert_time():
    time_str = input()
    time_parts = time_str.split(':')
    hr, min, second = map(float, time_parts)

    new_hr = hr + (min / 60.0) + (second / 3600.0)
    new_min = min + (second / 60.0)
    new_second = second

    return int(new_hr), round(new_min, 2), new_second

new_hr, new_min, new_second = convert_time()
print(f"{new_hr} hours, {new_min} minutes, and {new_second} seconds in decimal representation.")
